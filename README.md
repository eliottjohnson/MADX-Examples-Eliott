# MADX Examples - Eliott

These are just a few MADX examples I wrote to better understand how the program works.

## Instruction
located on my laptop at C:\Programming\MADX-Examples-Eliott is a MADX-test.madx file

Open linux terminal and run it by using

./madx-linux64-gnu MADX-examples-Eliott/MADX-test.madx

This will read the ps_mu.seq file and output a Twiss file and a Graph
